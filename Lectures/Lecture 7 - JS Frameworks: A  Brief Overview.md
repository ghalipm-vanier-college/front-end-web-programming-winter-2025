  ***Column Items***
  
  ***Type***: Whether itâ€™s a language, library, or framework.
  
  ***Learning Curve***: How easy it is to learn, based on concepts and syntax.
  
  ***Performance***: Speed and efficiency (e.g., DOM handling, bundle size).
  
  ***Scalability***: How well it handles growing app complexity.
  
  ***Ecosystem***: Available tools and libraries for development.
  
  ***Best For***: Ideal use cases for each.
  
  ***Context***: How each applies to your projects

***Key Takeaways for Projects***

***Vanilla JS***: Best for a small, static site with minimal interactivity

***Vue.js***: Ideal for your product page, as it handles reactivity (e.g., price updates, color changes) with a simple learning curve.

***React***: Good if need to scale small app into a full app (e.g., user profiles, chat), leveraging its ecosystem.

***Angular***: Overkill for your current projects but suitable for a large-scale dog-matching platform with complex features.
