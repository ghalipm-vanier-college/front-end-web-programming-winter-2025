***Bootstrap 5*** is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for creating responsive, mobile-first websites.

**Bootstrap** and **Tailwind CSS** are both widely used CSS frameworks for web development, 
each designed with a **mobile-first approach**. 
However, they differ significantly in their methodology and intended use cases.

**Bootstrap** provides **pre-built components** and a grid system for **rapid development**, 

**Tailwind CSS** offers a **utility-first approach for highly customizable designs**. 

Here's a more detailed comparison:

Bootstrap has mandatory meta data, css link and JS bundle to be included in a HTML5 file:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Bootstrap Example</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8"> <!-- charset for bootstrap-->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><!-- scaling for bootstrap-->
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"> <!-- styling for bootstrap-->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <!-- bundle JS script for bootstrap-->
</head>
```
Basic structure of Bootstrap consists of contanier, row, column. 
Container can have one or multiple rows and specific row can have one or more columns. 

```html
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4">Column 1</div>
      <div class="col-md-4">Column 2</div>
      <div class="col-md-4">Column 3</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
